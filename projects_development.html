                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Context:</span> It's important to conduct competitive analyses since they can help desginers understand the strengths and weaknesses of various designs and assess the competition.</p>
                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Objective:</span> Conduct a competitive analysis focusing on "favoriting functions" of a few websites, and assess their strengths and weaknesses. Develop a website using React with an aggregator, factoring in the strengths/weaknesses from the competitive analysis.</p>

                <p>My app consists of 2 filtering categories (genre, star rating), 2 sorting features (book length, star rating), an aggregator (want-to-read list), a list of active filters, a reset button (for resetting sorting and filtering), and 12 books with buttons to add/remove to want-to-read-list. I have provided the link <a href="https://csci-1300-2024-development.vercel.app/">here</a>.</p>

                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Reflections & Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>This project challenged my skills both as a designer and as a developer. I learned how to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the 4 website designs I selected and evaluate how my own React app would fit into competitive scene. This project gave me a greater appreciation for how design can influence how users' decision making. For example, the fact that items might expire from your wishlist on Abercrombie and Fitch might motivate users to buy the items.</p>
