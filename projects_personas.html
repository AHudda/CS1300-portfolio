                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>This self-checkout kiosk in Ten One Tea House allows the staff members on duty to focus on drink preparation by processing customers’ orders and handling payment. The interface is meant to increase staff efficiency and user satisfaction, since their drinks will be prepared faster.</p>

                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Objective:</span> Design and conduct user interviews to better understand users' perspectives of the interface. Utilize personas and storyboarding to illustrate the narrative of different types of potential users interacting with the interface.</p>
                
                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Observations</h3>
                <p>After brainstorming a list of questions I thought would be most relevant to assessing the user experience, I narrowed my list down to the questions below. Interviewing users was the most daunting portion of this project, but enabled me to view the interface design from their perspectives. </p>

                            <li>Reorder the category navigation bar & rename categories (e.g. “Aroma of
                                Fruit” = “Fruit Teas”).</li>
                        </ol>

                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Personas & Empathy Maps</h3>
                <p>Personas can help designers better understand potential users of the interface. I created two personas, Patient Pam and Stressed Susan, to represent the potential user base of the Ten One Tea House self-checkout kiosk. </p>

                    <div class="vertical-images">
                        <p class="no-bottom-margin">Pam has some experience with self-checkout kiosks, but it’s been a while since she first
                            came to Ten One Tea House! She struggles with communicating the overwhelming number of options to her daughter, 
                            as well as the lack of clarity regarding caffeine levels, how many ounces are in the medium versus the large, etc. 
                            Pam represents the parents who bring their children to get boba after school or on holidays.</p>

                        <p class="no-bottom-margin"> Susan is relatively tech-savvy and has general experience with these kinds of self-
                            checkout kiosks. She knows exactly which drink she wants, since she comes to Ten One Tea House Often, but struggles to find it on the interface.
                            The large screen makes her feel uncomfortable, and she felt peer-
                            pressured into tipping the staff. Susan represents Brown University college students - a stressed, hard-working college
                            student who lives nearby Ten One Tea House and order drinks from there frequently</p>

                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Compare & Contrast:</span> Although these personas are demographically different (occupation, age, stage in life),
                    they are the same gender, view boba as a special treat, and both associate a feeling of excitement
                    with getting boba. Additionally, both personas feel overwhelmed or stressed, but for different
                    reasons. While Susan is dealing with stress about her college class workload, Pam is concerned
                    about bonding and communicating with her daughter. Another key difference between the two
                    personas is that Susan is more familiar with the self-checkout kiosk in Ten One Tea House and
                    the Ten One Tea House teas and boba than Pam.

                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Storyboarding</h3>
                <p>To visualize how one of my personas, Stressed Susan, might interact with this interface, I created a storyboard to illustrate Susan leaving her dorm to get bubble tea, using the self-checkout kiosk, and receiving her drink.</p>
