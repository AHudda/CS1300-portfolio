                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>This self-checkout kiosk in Ten One Tea House allows the staff members on duty to focus on drink preparation by processing customersâ€™ orders and handling payment. The interface is meant to increase staff efficiency and user satisfaction, since their drinks will be prepared faster.</p>

                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Objective:</span> Design and conduct user interviews to better understand users' perspectives of the interface. Utilize personas and storyboarding to illustrate the narrative of different types of potential users interacting with the interface.</p>

                        <p class="larger-bottom-margin">Having identified key issues with the original website, I used "Crazy 8's Sketching" to brainstorm design ideas</p> 
                        <p class="right-align no-bottom-margin">I ultimately compiled my favorite design ideas into a final sketch</p>

                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Interviews</h3>
                <p>Inspired by my sketches, I utilized Figma to create a low-fidelity wireframe for various screen sizes: <span class="roboto-bold text-black">Computer, iPad, iPhone</span></p>

                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Personas</h3>
                <p>Personas can help designers better understand potential users of the interface. I created two personas, Patient Pam and Stressed Susan, to represent the potential user base of the Ten One Tea House self-checkout kiosk. </p>

                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Compare & Contrast:</span> Although these personas are demographically different (occupation, age, stage in life),
                    they are the same gender, view boba as a special treat, and both associate a feeling of excitement
                    with getting boba. Additionally, both personas feel overwhelmed or stressed, but for different
                    reasons. While Susan is dealing with stress about her college class workload, Pam is concerned
                    about bonding and communicating with her daughter. Another key difference between the two
                    personas is that Susan is more familiar with the self-checkout kiosk in Ten One Tea House and
                    the Ten One Tea House teas and boba than Pam.</p>


                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Storyboarding</h3>
                <p>To visualize how one of my personas, Stressed Susan, might interact with this interface, I created a storyboard to illustrate Susan leaving her dorm to get bubble tea, using the self-checkout kiosk, and receiving her drink.</p>
