                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Context:</span> The self-checkout kiosk in Ten One Tea House in Providence, Rhode Island, processes customers’ orders and handles payment. The interface is meant to increase staff efficiency, since staff members can focus on drink preparation rather than taking customers orders. This interface seeks to increase user satisfaction as well, since their drinks will be prepared faster.</p>
                <div class="center-align">
                    <img class="mediumImageSpecification" alt="sketch of the Ten One Tea House interface" src="assets/personas/sketch.png"/>
                </div>
                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Objective:</span> Who are common users of this interface? Design and conduct user interviews to better understand how users percieve this interface. Observe their interactions. Utilize personas and storyboarding to illustrate the narrative of different types of potential users interacting with the interface.</p>
                
                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Observations</h3>
                <p>I settled down with a bubble tea to observe users interact with the Ten One Tea House self-checkout kiosk.</p>
                <ol type = "i">
                    <li>Common points of difficulty</li>
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>Navigating the primary page</li>

                                </ol>

                                    <li>One user seemed flustered when they couldn't select both "medium" and "hot."</li>
                                    <li>Users who overlooked the "hot" option didn't display the same confusion.</li>
                                    <li>All users hesitated before selecting toppings.</li>
                                </ol>
                            <li>Tipping</li>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Some users glanced around briefly before selecting a tip amount.</li>

                </ol>

                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Interviews</h3>
                <p>After brainstorming a list of questions I thought would be most relevant to assessing the user experience, I narrowed my list down to the questions below. Interviewing users was the most daunting portion of this project, but enabled me to view the interface design from their perspectives. </p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Which elements of the primary screen drew your attention first?</li>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Photos of the drinks.</li>
                            <li>Category navigation bar.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Were there any moments where you felt unsure of what to do, lost, or uncomfortable
                        while navigating the interface?</li>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Information overload – too many options & too much scrolling.</li>
                            <li>Large tipping options - people nearby can see.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 6 (very easy), how easy was it to find your preferred
                        drink and customize it to your liking?</li>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Most common ratings: 3 & 4.</li>
                            <li>Hard to find the drink they wanted to select.</li>
                            <li>Confusing errors on customization page (e.g. "size" category groups medium/large/hot together, can select unavailable toppings).</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Were there any features or functionality that you expected to see in the interface that
                        weren’t there?</li>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Missing information about the teas: (caffiene, ounces in drink sizes, etc.).</li>
                            <li>Darker colored buttons to indicate that a button is “clickable.”</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>If you could redesign one aspect of the interface to better meet your needs, what would it
                        be?</li>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Further categorization of the teas (e.g. group all "Oolong" teas together).</li>
                            <li>Reorder the category navigation bar & rename categories (e.g. “Aroma of
                                Fruit” = “Fruit Teas”).</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Have you used similar technology before, and if so, approximately how frequently?</li>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>All users have used this technology before.</li>
                            <li>Frequency: once every two weeks or once a month.</li>
                        </ol>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Personas & Empathy Maps</h3>
                <p>After conducting user interviews and observing people interact with the self-checkout kiosk, I developed personas to gain a more holistic view of potential interface users.</p>
                <div class="parallel_content right-align align_spacing">
                    <div class="vertical-images">
                        <p class="no-bottom-margin">Pam has some experience with self-checkout kiosks, but it’s been a while since she first
                            came to Ten One Tea House! She struggles with communicating the overwhelming number of options to her daughter, 
                            as well as the lack of clarity regarding caffeine levels, how many ounces are in the medium versus the large, etc. 
                            Pam represents the parents who bring their children to get boba after school or on holidays.</p>
                        <div class="right-arrow largest-left-margin">
                            <img alt="right pointing arrow" src="assets/right-arrow.png">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <img class="midSmallImageSpecification" alt="patient pam persona" src="assets/personas/patient_pam.png"/>

                    <div class="vertical-images">
                        <p class="no-bottom-margin"> Susan is relatively tech-savvy and has general experience with these kinds of self-
                            checkout kiosks. She knows exactly which drink she wants, since she comes to Ten One Tea House Often, but struggles to find it on the interface.
                            The large screen makes her feel uncomfortable, and she felt peer-
                            pressured into tipping the staff. Susan represents Brown University college students - a stressed, hard-working college
                            student who lives nearby Ten One Tea House and order drinks from there frequently</p>
                        <div class="left-arrow larger-right-margin">
                            <img alt="left pointing arrow" src="assets/left-arrow.png">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Compare & Contrast:</span> Although these personas are demographically different (occupation, age, stage in life),
                    they are the same gender, view boba as a special treat, and both associate a feeling of excitement
                    with getting boba. Additionally, both personas feel overwhelmed or stressed, but for different
                    reasons. While Susan is dealing with stress about her college class workload, Pam is concerned
                    about bonding and communicating with her daughter. Another key difference between the two
                    personas is that Susan is more familiar with the self-checkout kiosk in Ten One Tea House and
                    the Ten One Tea House teas and boba than Pam.

                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Storyboarding</h3>
                <p>To visualize how one of my personas, Stressed Susan, might interact with this interface, I created a storyboard to illustrate Susan leaving her dorm to get bubble tea, using the self-checkout kiosk, and receiving her drink.</p>
                <div class="center-align">
                    <img class="mediumImageSpecification" alt="storyboard" src="assets/personas/storyboard.png"/>
                </div>
                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Reflections & Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>Through this project I stepped out of my comfort zone to interview people who I did not know personally, brainstormed potential users of an interface by creating personas and a storyboard, and enhanced my understanding of how different types of people interact with the same interface. This project helped me grow as a designer, and helped me realize how important it is to seek feedback from interface users (not just my peers!). </p>
                <p>The confusing design of the Ten One Tea House self-checkout kiosk might have dissuaded customers from purchasing their drinks. This project prompted me to think critically about how design can help (or hinder!) users from making decisions.</p>
