                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Context:</span> Imagine you are a Washington DC resident who wants to be more involved with your neighborhood's community association. Interested in donating to the association and attending the next meeting, you navigate to the <a href="https://foxhall.org/">Foxhall Community Citizens Association website</a> and see the following:</p>
                <div class="center-align">
                    <img class="mediumImageSpecification" alt="original webpage" src="assets/responsive_redesign/originalWebpageAnnotated.png"/>
                </div>
                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Problem:</span> This website is difficult to navigate. The lack of visual hierarchy and inconsistent typography makes it hard to find information. The small font makes the text difficult to read. Overall, the website feels crowded, unorganized, and overwhelming.</p>
                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Objective:</span> How can this website be redesigned and redeveloped to feature a clear visual hiearchy, high contrast color scheme, fun pictures, and support accessibility, while maintaining a historical theme?</p>
                <p><span class="roboto-bold">Inspirational Design Principles</span> (that will guide my design choices)</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Learnability: how easy is the website for people to learn?</li>
                    <li>Memorability: how easy is it for people to remember how to use the website?</li>
                    <li>Usability: how easy is this website to use?</li>
                    <li>Accessiblity: how well does this website accomodate for people with various disabilities?</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="parallel_content">
                    <img class="smallestImageSpecification" alt="crazy 8's sketches" src="assets/responsive_redesign/sketches.jpg"/>

                        </div>
                        <p class="larger-bottom-margin">Having identified key issues with the original website, I used "Crazy 8's Sketching" to brainstorm design ideas</p> 
                        <p class="right-align no-bottom-margin">I ultimately compiled my favorite design ideas into a final sketch</p> 
                        <div class="right-arrow">
                            <img alt="right pointing arrow" src="assets/right-arrow.png">

                </div>

                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                <p>Inspired by my sketches, I utilized Figma to create a low-fidelity wireframe for various screen sizes: <span class="roboto-bold text-black">Computer, iPad, iPhone</span></p>
                <img class="largestImageSpecification image-border" alt="computer low-fidelity wireframes" src="assets/responsive_redesign/computerLowFi.png"/>
                <div class="parallel_images">
                    <img class="smallerImageSpecification smaller-left-margin image-border" alt="ipad low-fidelity wireframe" src="assets/responsive_redesign/ipadLowFi.png"/>
                    <img class="tinyImageSpecifcation image-border" alt="phone low-fidelity wireframe" src="assets/responsive_redesign/phoneLowFi.png"/>
                </div>

                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Visual Style Guide</h3>
                <div class="parallel_content right-align align_spacing">
                    <div class="vertical-images">
                        <p class="no-bottom-margin"> How can I replicate the historical theme of the original page while increasing the color contrast and overall, provide more visual clarity? I chose a beige & maroon red theme to fit the brick architecture of the neighborhood buildings.</p>
                        <div class="right-arrow larger-left-margin">
                            <img alt="right pointing arrow" src="assets/right-arrow.png">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <img class="smallerImageSpecification" alt="visual style guide" src="assets/responsive_redesign/visualStyleGuide.png"/>  
                </div>

                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">High-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                <p>Drawing upon my low-fidelity wireframes and visual style guide, here's the final product I designed for the following screen sizes: <span class="roboto-bold text-black">Computer, iPad, iPhone</span></p>
                <div class="center-align">
                    <img class="standardImageSpecification image-border" alt="computer high-fidelity wireframes" src="assets/responsive_redesign/computerHighFi.png"/>
                </div>
                <div class="parallel_images">
                    <img class="smallerImageSpecification image-border" alt="ipad high-fidelity wireframe" src="assets/responsive_redesign/ipadHighFi.png"/>
                    <img class="tinyImageSpecifcation image-border" alt="phone high-fidelity wireframe" src="assets/responsive_redesign/phoneHighFi.png"/>
                </div>
                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Develop a Responsive Website (HTML/CSS)</h3>
                <p>My final task is to code my redesigned website using html and css. My website can be viewed on any device, and I have provided the link <a href="https://ahudda.github.io/CS1300-2024-responsive-redesign/">here</a>. I had to make a few modifications to my original design but overall I really enjoyed this process!</p>
                <h3 class="extra-top-margin">Reflections & Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>I learned a lot from the process of redesigning and building this webpage. I found myself practicing iterative design throughout my design process, as I would feel unsatisfied with a certain decision and go back and refine the design. I learned how to ask for specific feedback from my peers and keep an open mind when hearing their constructive criticism. I developed my understanding of how design can influence user decision-making.</p>
                <p>I'm excited to share my proposed website redesign to the FCCA (Foxhall Community Citizens Association) and hear their feedback as well!</p>
